The concentric rings that appear in a vibrating glass of water are known as nodal domains. If the glass is oddly shaped rather than round, the nodal domains are complicated structures with no discernable pattern as seen in the figure below where each nodal domain is shown in a different color. The mathematics behind these waves are the same for a glass of water, a vibrating drum head, the surface of the earth during an earthquake, and many mechanical systems. Thus, understanding such waves has diverse applications in engineering and the physical sciences. The same mathematics also applies to the quantum waves of subatomic particles. My research consists of numerical analyses of properties of nodal domains in such quantum systems.
